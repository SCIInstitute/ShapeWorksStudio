## Shapeworks Studio has been integrated into ShapeWorks main repo

Thanks for your interest in ShapeWork tools. 

Recently, we have been devoting more efforts towards ShapeWorks development with improved preprocessing tools and usability as our top priorities â€¦ ShapeWorksStudio has been integrated into the ShapeWorks repo to leverage the underlying computational tools and expose the recent prep/post tools within Studio.

To get the latest ShapeWorks tools, go to the Github page and follow the instructions in the top-level README: https://github.com/SCIInstitute/ShapeWorks

We plan to have downloadable builds for different platforms, and until then it should be easy to build your own version locally, see the [README](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/ShapeWorks/blob/master/README.md)

We also have a standard shape analysis workflow scripted in python. Please see https://github.com/SCIInstitute/ShapeWorks/tree/master/UseCaseDocumentation/ellipsoidMain.py 

If you have any questions, please email shapeworks-users@sci.utah.edu or for an even faster response, post your questions to our [Gitter forum](https://gitter.im/ShapeWorks/ShapeWorks).
